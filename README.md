# PMCC-Characters-in-Legacy-XP
A patch to include the forbidden four in Legacy XP

This is a Super Smash Bros. Legacy Xp patch and the objective is to have access to the leaked characters in the Project M, for this I used the files from Project M Community Complete.

# How to install (Dolphin):
Go to the place where you have your Legacy XP copy, then go to the next route: 

...\Smash Bros LXP [Dolphin]\Dolphin LXP\Config\User\Wii

Open the sd card with WinImage and drop all the files inside the sd here:

\LegacyXP\pf

Then save and close the image and run the game using the launcher.
